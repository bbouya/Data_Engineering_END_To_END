> The abstract concept of 'human' is type, class,

> Real people such as myself, parents, and friends are called Objects


- A type called 'List'
  - It has attributes, methods, etc. that List has.

- The object of the list is itself and state that is specifically held in memory such as numbers and letters

A class is a frame, and an object is what is created from it.

## Understanding and Using Constructors (__init__)
> A function called when a Python object is created

### __init__(self)
- Constructor, called when a class instance is created
- The self argument always comes first and points to itself
- The name does not have to be self, but it is customary to use self
- In the constructor, the data handled by the class is defined.
  - This data is called a member variable or attribute
